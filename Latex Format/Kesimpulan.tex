\chapter{Conclusions and Recommendations}
\section{Conclusions}
After the implementation, testing, and analyzing process have been done, it could be concluded that:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Indoor Routing System could be implemented using three dimensional spaces.
	\item The most suitable Shortest Path Algorithm to the three dimensional spaces data between Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford, and A* Algorithms is A* Algorithm that give the smallest value of execution time.
	  
\end{enumerate}
\section{Future Work}
Since this final project have been done, there are a few recommendations to make this project better, those are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add some more dataset until the whole area of Telkom University. After that, it could be published in college's website so this system could be used for everyone.
	\item Find another better way to get the exact longitude and latitude for the points. One of the examples is take a long walk from points to points and record the Longitude and Latitude coordinates.
	\item It would be better if the graph could be viewed with the 3D blueprints of the buildings. 
\end{enumerate}
