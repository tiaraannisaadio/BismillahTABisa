\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all, let's pray and thank to our God, Allah SWT, the lord of the universe who has been giving us mercies and blessings. Secondly, may sholawat and salam always be with our best prophet Muhammad SAW, who has guided us from the darkness to the light. The completion of this final project could not have been possible without all support and assistance of many people whose names may not all be enumerated. I would like to express them deep appreciation particularly to the following:
